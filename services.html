				<h2>Web Development</h2>
				<p>
	Aionys is someone to turn to for your software development needs. Our developers are well-versed in core software development technologies, frameworks, and market standards. Having experience with both consumer and B2B software, Aionys can be a valuable software development partner.
We begin by consulting with you to determine your project requirements. We also analyze and recommend the best tools for you. We work with HTML5, different JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React, etc.), Java, .NET, Node.js, CMS, etc., which means our dedicated experts can combine multiple technologies to create exactly what your business needs. Once we have determined the necessary technologies and milestones for the development process, our team of experts builds a working prototype. After reviews, verification, and rigorous testing, we provide you with the finished product.
But our partnership doesn’t end there. Aionys will also stay in touch with you to create future iterations of your software as needed, as well as assist you with your upcoming projects.

				<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
				<p>
	How much is quality worth? When a user has to deal with annoying problems, the original value of the product is lost.
Identifying all potential problems and usability issues can be a tough and time-consuming task.
All products Aionys delivers are thoroughly tested by our Quality Assurance engineers.
  <br>Aionys offers various QA consulting services to our clients, such as:</p>
<h4>&#149; Manual testing</h4><p>Testing is the key to identifying usability issues. QA engineers act as end users and check to make sure all features of the application work correctly and in full accordance with the requirement specifications. We provide the talent and tools to deliver your product with a faster time-to-market as well as measurable improvements in quality and cost reduction. Leveraging our services allows you to test earlier and more often and to identify defects when they are less costly to remediate.</p>
<h4>&#149; Automated testing</h4><p>Numerous repetitions of identical test cases are a waste of time and money. Automated tests may be written once and then can be run quickly and frequently after. This keeps projects cost-effective and guarantees a long maintenance life. That's why we are the preeminent provider of test automation, combining the speed and cost-savings benefits of software test automation with low-cost offshore testing resources.</p>
